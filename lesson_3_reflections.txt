When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I need to keep history or changes or collaborating a project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may not want to pull some of the changes made by other people.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Use forks when you want to modify a repository that you don't have permission to modify to your repository. Clone it when you need a local copy of it. Create branches when you have experimental features that will be different from the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To prevent conflicts and merge safely.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would prefer sit with the people I'm working with and make sure we are not working on the same thing using something like dropbox or Google drive. Git or Github will be much easier because it is very powerful that you can see the list of changes figured out for you and comment on it if necessary.
